## Final Project

Project Description: Using Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) concepts, students should write a paper in order to utilizing AGT in other fields to solve an open problem. Note that in this project, students were allowed to use previous research papers to combine their proposed ideas to create a new one for their paper.
